How to use the programs in this project:

1. git clone https://github.com/chihoon1/supervised_learning.git  # install this git repo to local computer
2. python -m venv venv # set up virtual environment for python project
3. pip install -r requirements.txt # install all the library packages needed for persistent homology algorithm
4. invoke any traditional supervised learning ML algorithm functions in the project

The implementations of supervised learning algorithms are tested in the .py file where algorithms are implemented or in .ipynb file
